Points to remember while testing the app
First setup the backend by following instructions in this repository
When testing on android emulator, if you get a connection error use http://10.0.2.2/ instead of localhost
iOS emulator doesn't support camera, this will give an error, use a real device to test AI features.
On real devices, make sure your PC and mobile are connected to same network, use network IP address instead of localhost
Don't forgot the PORT number
Allow permissions for camera and mic when asked
Make sure the BACKEND_URL is appended with /api
